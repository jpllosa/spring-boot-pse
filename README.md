Investing in the Philippine Stock Exchange Web App

This web app will show how your chosen stock in the Philippine Stock Exchange performed if you have invested for a certain number of years. The period covered is roughly from 2005-01-02 to 2016-07-27. Only a select few stocks are covered and these stocks existed during the period covered. In short, this web app answers the question *"How much money would I have made/lost if I bought this stock and held for x years?"*.

This is just a side project in order learn about **Spring Boot**, **MongoDb**, **Unit Testing in Spring Boot**, **FreeMarker**, **JavaScript**, **JQuery**, **Maven**, **Markdown**, **GitHub/git**, **Heroku**, **REST API**, **JSON**, **morris.js**, **datepicker**, **bootstrap**, **Continuous Deployment** and whatever was needed to get this web app up and running.
